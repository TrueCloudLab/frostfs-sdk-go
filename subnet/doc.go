/*
Package subnet collects functionality related to the FrostFS subnets.

Subnet of a particular FrostFS network consists of a subset of the storage nodes
of that network. Subnet of the whole network is called zero. Info type acts as
a subnet descriptor. Each subnet is owned by the user who created it. Information
about all subnets is stored in the Subnet contract of the FrostFS Sidechain.
